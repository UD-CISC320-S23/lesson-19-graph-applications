Description of project

**<h2>Maxwell Wang</h2>**

This project I am working on will be a neighborhood problem
implementing Depth-First Search algorithm. The dfs algorithm
will create a path of a person visiting every house within a certain
neighborhood in an undirected graph while exploring the hood. Each node represents a house and an edge representing the
time between two houses. Let's use a dfs traversal to make sure
the person is able to walk to all houses in this neighborhood.

## Installation Code

```sh
$> pip install networkx
```
