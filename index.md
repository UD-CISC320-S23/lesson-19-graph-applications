It's a band festival! There are bands playing at a local park, however no band can play directly beside another band, otherwise it'd be too noisy and hard to listen to each individual band's music! Therefore, a float must be placed inbetween each band so that way their music doesn't clash with eachother! Band 1 must also find the shortest path to get to Band 22.

## Installation Code

```sh
$> pip install networkx
```

## Python Environment Setup

```python
import networkx as nx
```

# Band 1 to Band 22
