# Amazing Maze: Find Your Way Out

**Informal Description:**
Mazes have been a challenging source of entertainment for people of all ages for centuries. From the childhood joy of solving mazes in puzzle books to haunted houses and corn mazes, we all have some memory associated with mazes. Some people however, do not like mazes. For these people we have an algorithm that works like magic for the next time you wake up in a haunted house or the middle of a corn maze assuming you were left with a map.

>**Formal Description:**
> * Input: An unweighted, undirected graph G = (V, E), s, where V is the set of verticies (maze junctions), E is the set of edges (paths connecting junctions), and s being the starting vertex in V.
> * Output: A set of verticies in V representing the path out of the maze
