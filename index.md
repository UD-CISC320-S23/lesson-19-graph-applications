# First Problem Title

**Informal Description**:
As the head of transportation for the University of Delaware, you have been
tasked with installing several charging stations for UD's new electric bus
program, which will provide a clean and efficient transportation system for
students. However, due to certain power dependencies, the charging stations
must be installed in a certain order to ensure all are functioning on the
same grid. Determine a correct order of installation by performing a
topological sort (through implementing a DFS) on the directed, acyclic graph
of power stations.
