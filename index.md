The tradition of board games dates back millennia and has been enjoyed by countless generations.
On the other hand, modern graph theory has only developed over the last couple of centuries.
However, as we will demonstrate, the two are more connected than you think; we can use graph
theory to look at and solve our favorite timeless games in brand-new ways. In many ways,
the problems mirror the topic: Like a board game connecting the young and old generations, we
shall connect this ancient pass time with modern theory.
