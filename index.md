# First Problem Title

**Informal Description**:
As the newest volunteer for University of Delaware's electric bus program, you are
given a graph representing the order of bus stops you must make depending
on which charging station you start from, where each node represents a stop (including
charging stations) and the edges represent the order in which you must make the stops
which the edge connects. By applying a depth first search, create a topological sort
of the graph to determine the sequence of stops you must make from every possible charging station.
