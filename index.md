# Skill Web

**Many video games inclue a web of different skills you can get for your character. These are usually shown in the form of a web where getting one skill opens up several others. The goal here is to identify all of the skills that will be open to you once a certain skill is unlocked**: 

> **This problem uses a depth first search to identify all nodes reachable in a directed graph from one specific node.**:
>  * Input: A directed graph of skills and a specific skill
>  * Output: A list of reachable skills from that specific skill

**Graph Problem/Algorithm**: DFS


**Setup code**:

```
G = nx.petersen_graph()

print(list(G.nodes))
nx.draw(G)
plt.show()
```
